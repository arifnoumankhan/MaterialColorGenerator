# Material Color Generator

This is a small tool which should you help to select the right colors for your project. If you like this tool please star it.

You can specify your main color and you will get the matching colors for UI Elements as described in the
[Building Apps with Material Design](https://youtu.be/LtD7eJp2ILo?t=6m1s) talk about Wear 2.0 on the Google
I/O 2016.

Basically the colors are calculated based on the [HSB or HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)
color space. Here is a screenshot taken from the Video above:
